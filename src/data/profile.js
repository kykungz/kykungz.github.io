      Hi, my name is <b>Jacky</b>.
      I am currently a Software Engineering student at Kasetsart University.
      I was fascinated by the art of programming,
      which brought me into this challenging field.
      I'm also looking for an internship in a software development company.
      If you are interested in me, feel free to <a href="/">contact</a>!
